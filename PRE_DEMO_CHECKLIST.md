## 💬 **Key Talking Points**

### **Introduction**

_"GlamGo is a beauty services marketplace connecting three key users: customers looking for services, vendors providing services, and drivers delivering products."_

### **No Authentication Required**

_"Notice users can browse and explore without creating an account. This reduces friction and increases conversions."_

### **Search & Filter**

_"Real-time search and category filtering help users find exactly what they need quickly."_

### **Product Details**

_"Each service has comprehensive information - transparent pricing, duration, location, ratings from real customers, and amenities."_

### **Role-Based Experience**

_"Each user type has a customized dashboard. Customers shop and book, vendors manage their business, drivers earn through deliveries."_

### **Future (Phase 3)**
